# Coding Challenge


## Story

- Create an app for viewing one or more rss feeds.
	- HTTP and the like for retrieval.

- You should be able to see the updates to the feed live, as and when they happen.
	- Rx observables for the feed for bonus points.

- You should be able to mark items from the feed as favourites.
	- Some bit of fancy pants UI.

- Favourites should be cacheable for viewing later, must be viewable when the browser refreshes.
	- I would suggest using localstorage (or a database).

- Whenever a user clicks on an item for details. This must be recorded...
	- Over time stats should be generated for the user actions.
	- This could be done using a WebWorker.

- Something with file Blobs...
- Something with Audio elements...
